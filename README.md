# ☕ Demo Spring Boot + Java Interview Questions

A sandbox project that serves two purposes in one place:

1. **Play around** with Spring Boot features and build simple APIs.
2. Host a curated list of **Java + Spring backend interview questions** (collected from interviews held between Feb–May 2024).

## 🎯 Goals & Value

* Provide a **hands-on playground** to experiment with Spring Boot (controllers, services, repositories, etc.)
* Give you **real interview questions** as a reference: great for revising before backend Java interviews
* Serve as a **starter template** or boilerplate for your own backend projects

---

## ✨ Features

* Modular Spring Boot structure (controllers, services, repositories)
* Example REST endpoints (CRUD, error handling, etc.)
* Interview Q&A section stored in the repository
* Easy to extend with new features (security, caching, etc.)
* Minimal dependencies, clean setup

## 📂 Structure (example)

Here’s a likely project structure (you can adjust based on your own layout):

```
├── .github/               # GitHub Actions, workflows (if any)
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/           # Java source code
│   │   │   └── com/…        # Packages: controllers, services, repositories, models
│   │   └── resources/       # application.properties / yaml, static files
│   └── test/                # Unit / integration tests
├── pom.xml (or build.gradle)  # Build file, dependencies
├── README.md                # This file
└── interview-questions.md (or similar)  # Your curated Q&A file
```

## 🛠️ Setup & Run Locally

Here’s how you can clone and run the project on your machine:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/animesh2411/demo-springboot-interview.git

# 2. Change into directory
cd demo-springboot-interview

# 3. Build project (depending on your build tool)

# If Maven:
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Or if using local Maven:
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

# If Gradle (if project uses Gradle instead):
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew bootRun
```

Once the application starts, you can navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` (or the port configured) and test the endpoints using Postman, curl, or any API client.

## 🧠 Interview Questions Section

In this repository, you’ll find a file (e.g. `interview-questions.md` or similar) containing questions asked in Java / Spring backend interviews between Feb–May 2024.
Use it to:

* Quiz yourself or peers
* Add answers / explanations over time
* Track which topics you’re weak in and improve

---

## 🌱 How to Extend This Project

You can expand or adapt this project in many ways:

* Add **Spring Security** for auth & roles
* Integrate a **database** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
* Add **unit & integration tests** (JUnit, Mockito)
* Add **exception handling & global error handlers**
* Add **logging, caching, monitoring, metrics**
* Add more **interview questions & answers**, especially new ones
